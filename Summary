The application is a product listing page where various products are displayed in a grid format.
The basic structure and layout of the page have been created using HTML and styled using CSS. Flexbox has been used for responsive design and positioning elements on the page.
JavaScript has been used to add dynamic functionality to the page. It is used to load products, handle filtering by price and color, sorting, and pagination.
Product data is fetched from a JSON file containing information about different products, such as name, description, price, discount price, color, and image URLs.
Users can filter products based on price ranges and colors. They can also sort the products by name and price (ascending or descending).
A star rating system has been implemented using JavaScript and CSS. Users can rate products by clicking on the stars.
An "Add to Cart" button is provided for each product.
The page is designed to be responsive and adapt to different screen sizes using CSS media queries.
The page supports interactivity, such as hovering over stars to highlight and clicking on stars to set the rating.
The technologies used include HTML, CSS, JavaScript (Vanilla), and JSON data for the product information.
